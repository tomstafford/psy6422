# Class of 2025

A showcase of some projects from the class of 2024-25. 

Again, there were too many students to show all projects, so here are a few highlights. Many creative, fun, interesting, challenging visualisation projects were produced but aren't shown here, but these few give a flavour of what student's got up to:

Kim was inspired by his commute to visualise [seasonal patterns in British rail cancellations](https://giskler.github.io/psy6422_project). ([Repo](https://github.com/giskler/psy6422_project)):

Emma used animation to make her graph of the [Game of Thrones season] ratings(https://emwalker01.github.io/GoT_Ratings/) something of a visual gag. See if you can spot the odd season out. ([repo](https://github.com/emwalker01/GoT_Ratings))
