# Notes

## Credit

These pages based on [a template](https://psyteachr.github.io/book-template/) published by the awesome [psyTeachR team](https://psyteachr.github.io/about/). Extra thanks to Lisa DeBruine for help.

## Colophon

Everything worked better when I:

* set GitHub pages to run off of Master/docs
* listened to Lisa and used bookdown at the CL, not knit in Rstudio, to render the pages: ``R -e 'bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")'``
* installed [R 3.6](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html)
* installed tidyverse, bookdown, devtools and finally [Webex](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/webex).

## Data Science @ Sheffield

The [MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/prospectivepg/masters/data-science), of which [this module](index.html) is a core part, is designed to teach graduate psychologists data science skills. If you don't have a psychology background our other [MSc courses in cognitive neuroscience](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/prospectivepg/masters) can operate as "conversion courses", since they are designed to teach core psychology/neuroscience skills to people from non-psychology backgrounds.

Our MSc is not the only way you can study data science at the University of Sheffield. The [MSc in Data Analytics](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2020/data-analytics-msc) is taught in the Department of Computer Science and has a stronger focus on computational tools such as machine learning. The [MSc in Data Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2020/data-science-msc) is in the Information School which is in the Faculty of Social Science, and has more of a focus on business decisions and using data in organisations. We also highly recommend the [MSc in Social Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2020/social-research-ma), run by the [Sheffield Methods Institute](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smi), which teaches a full suite of quantative and qualatative research skills. The SMI is also home to the [Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smi/postgraduate/data-analytics-society-cdt) which offers opportunities to undertake a 4-year funded integrated MSc and PhD.

## Careers

Inside or outside of research, data management and visualisation skills will be good for your career. Unlike many high-technical skills, coding is highly accessible. Even in the world of software development, over half of programmers are [self-taught](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2908474/stack-overflow-survey-finds-nearly-half-have-no-degree-in-computer-science.html). But coding is relevant to more than just pure software jobs, [one report](https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/coding-skills/) found that 20% of graduate-level jobs value coding as a skill, and these jobs paid on average 30% more than other graduate jobs.
