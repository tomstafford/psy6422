## Exercises

We are going to follow [Lisa DeBruine](https://debruine.github.io/)'s tutorial -  [First Shiny App](https://psyteachr.github.io/shiny-tutorials/01-first-app.html).

Additional challenges / exercises  

* Make scatterplot rather than histogram
* Make the app load data which you save in the project directory
* Deploy to the web with [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)
  * This page may be helpful when combining exercises 2 and 3: [Why does my app work locally, but not on shinyapps.io](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/229848967-Why-does-my-app-work-locally-but-not-on-shinyapps-io-)
* Look for and share additional resources on shiny apps
