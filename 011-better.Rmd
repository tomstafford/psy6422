# Advanced Topics

```{block, type="info"}
*Note this is a placeholder page. This material hasn't been taught yet. I am adding notes online as I can, so these pages in particular may evolve quickly*
```

Rather than teach substantive content, in this class I will showcase important advanced topics which you may wish to explore after the course. The idea is that it will be faster for you to set out on your own with a quick overview of the data science landscape. This way at least you will have heard of potential solutions when you encounter future problems.
