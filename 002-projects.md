## Data Management

Everything recorded during an experiment, whether by you or the computer, is data. All log files. Everything.

Never delete *any* data.

All data should be backed-up automatically. Any back up process which requires you to remember to deploy it is fragile. Use a cloud synchronisation service like Google Drive or Dropbox. 

Never edit the raw data files. They should exist is a folder called \raw or \data and only ever be opened, never modified in any way
