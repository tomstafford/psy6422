# - Database queries: SQL {-}

## Context

SQL, you can pronouce it S-Q-L or "sequel", is a database system. It is old, in internet terms, but not going anywhere, and core to many data science jobs. 

## Key information

There are different flavours, such as MySQL which is used by WordPress websites, or PostgreSQL / postgres.

The common core of SQL is that that it is a 'relational' database management systems. It is used for storing information and saying how it is connected to other bits of information. Compare this to the spreadsheet/CSV, which stores information in a list.

Note that SQL is designed for databases with potentially billions of rows of data. It demands working habits where you can't "look" at the data all at once, as you would with a spreadsheet.

SQL has it's [own terminology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_syntax) but to start off we will think about two things

* Tables: these are rows and columns of data.
* Queries: these are commands we use to select, pull out and/or combine tables

Tables have 'fields' (which you may think of as columns) and 'records' (which you may think of as rows)

## Exercises

In class, I will illustrate the key concepts of SQL with an example. Then we will look at this interactive turorial:
