Functions

### Functions {#functions}

We need to add one *argument*, the p-value you want to report. The names you choose for the arguments are private to that argument, so it is not a problem if they conflict with other variables in your script. You put the arguments in the parentheses after `function` in the order you want them to default (just like the built-in functions you've used before). 

```{r}
report_p <- function(p) {
}
```
