# Git and Github

With our guest lecturer, Seb James

## Before the class

Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one.

Make sure you have access to git on your computer:

 * Students using windows can install: https://gitforwindows.org/ Once installed they should be able to open a git bash window and type ``git --version``
 * Students on a Mac will have git if they install 'Xcode' and 'Command line tools for Xcode'.They can test by opening a terminal and typing ``git --version``
