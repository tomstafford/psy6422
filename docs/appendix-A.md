## Ask me questions

Feel free to email me with questions about any aspect of the course, or problem you are having with the work, but you must include your current best answer to your own question, along with what you've tried so far (and why it didn't work).


## Terminology: 'Raw data'

Data before any processing has been done. Usually these means that the individual responses which create the data are recorded

The opposite is cleaned data (once it has been processed) and then after that summary data (in which responses are collapsed across individuals or into groups)
