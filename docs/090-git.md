# Git and Github

:::: {.info}
*Spring 2023: This class will need to be rewritten because the guest lecturer can't teach it this year. [Seb James](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/people/research/sebastian-james-0) taught this class over the last three years - thanks Seb!

## Motivation

Git is an incredible common tool among software developers and computer scientists. It has powerful functionality for coordinate code projects across many people. As a core data science tool I want everyone on the course to have had some exposure to it, and to recognise the key concepts (as well as the value it has). We will not be using the full functionality in the course.


## Before the class

Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one.

Install git on your machine. 

  * On Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
  * On Mac: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
  
Until you do that you DON'T have the git features enabled in RStudio.


## Accessing git 

If you have RStudio you can access git using point and click (top right), or via the terminal (the tab next to Console on the bottom right). 

Outside of RStudio:

 * Students using Windows can install: https://gitforwindows.org/ Once installed they should be able to open a git bash window and type ``git --version``
 * Students on a Mac will have git if they install 'Xcode' and 'Command line tools for Xcode'.They can test by opening a terminal and typing ``git --version``

## Essential terminology

repo: "repository". A set of files which are in the same project and for which version control using git is appliued

remote and local: repositories can be on your computer (local) or online, e.g. on github.com (remote)

clone: make a copy of a repo

branches: repos can exist in different versions, "branches"

Other terminology, commit, merge, rebase, push/pull: see below

## Checklist

Git and github are fundamental tools which will be relevant for collaborating on reliable computational projects, but it is not essential you master the full range of capabilities they offer for this module.

By the end of this class you should

* have a github account
* installed git on your local machine
* understand why git is useful for code projects
* recognise the essential terminology: repo/repository, remotes and local, clone, branches, commit, merge, rebase, push/pull
