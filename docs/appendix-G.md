# Class of 2023

A showcase of some projects from the class of 2022-23. 

There were too many students on the module this year to show all projects, so here are a few highlights. Many creative, fun, interesting, challenging visualisation projects were produced but aren't shown here, but these few give a flavour of what student's got up to:

Gabriel's project looked at [the number of Autism referrals in England before, during, and after lockdown](https://gabrieltld.github.io/psy6422-modproj/)

I found Grace's plot of [A Decade of Demand on the National Grid"](https://graceesh.github.io/psy6422_energy_demand/) really informative - spot the lockdown months!

Jennifer's project on the number of [Freddos Afforded With The Minimum Wage: From 2000 to 2023](https://jstandeven.github.io/PSY6422_Project/]) seems very relevant to the state of society, as well as illustrating [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox) for across different points of time.
