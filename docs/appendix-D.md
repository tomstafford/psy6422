# Class of 2020

This was the first year the [MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/prospectivepg/masters/data-science) has run, of which this is key module.

Most students came into this module with little or no previous experience of coding. I hope you agree they should be proud of what they have achieved, and my hope is that the skills taught on this module have set them up to use powerful, flexible, computational methods to produce reproducible analysis and useful data visualisaions in the rest of their work.




Here just a few examples of data visualisations produced by the class for their [final projects](docs/final-project.html). Each project was different, and each student published their data, analysis code and visualisation as an online notebook (so click the link for more).

Hala took open data from Sheffield city council and showed [daily cycles in air pollution levels](https://halaaj.github.io/PSY6422/)

Nabia looked at [Students' Performance in Exams](https://nabihaahmad.github.io/) and used these boxplots with jittered points, which allow you to see the group average but also the underlying data
