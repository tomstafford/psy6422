The final project is a chance to deploy all the skills taught on the course in a single complete data visualations project, which takes us from raw data and a question through data preparation and exploration through to publishing a visualisation and the documentation which shares your findings with others. 9.4 Project requirements A complete project, including raw data, analysis scripts, documentation and visualisations shared in a way that allows the visualisation to be reproduced and understood In practice, this means you should upload a project to github, containing a Rmarkdown file which explains your visualisation, as taught in the module (although alternatives are acceptable if they meet the primary criteria). Please include these headings in your project Data Origins Answering questions of where it comes from, how it was collected, what the variables mean, etc show the first few rows of the raw data, if possible Research Questions in plain english, a simple statement of what question(s) your visulisation will attempt to address Data Preparation steps taken to clean the data, exclude outliers, create summary statistics, grouped variables, etc show the first few rows of the processed data, if possible showing the code which does this were relevant Visualisation(s) graph or graphs documentation explaining any motivation (although good graph labelling is better than explanation in the accompanying text) code for producing them Summary Brief thoughts on what you have learnt, what you might do next if you had more time / more data The ultimate aim is to make something that looks good and shows off your abilities. You want to produce something you are proud to show people (including future employers and supervisors) 9.5 Choosing your data The data is an excuse for the data visualisation, so don’t agonise over this, and go for simple over complex if you have a choice. I recommend you find a data set with variables which you understand. The lecture on March 19th covered how to find open data. 9.5.1 Finding Data I will update these notes soon, but basically many papers are now published accommpanied by open data. Sometimes this is indicated by an Open Data Badge. For example, take a look at the current table of contents for Psychological Science. The badges are an initiative of the Centre for Open Science https://cos.io/our-services/open-science-badges/ You can also search a preprint archive such as psyarxiv. Many, but not all, papers published as preprints will have open data. You can also search OSF.io directly. Pick a topic and have a look at what is available The other route is large publicly available resources, such as Our World in Data 9.6 Choose your graph You only need to draw one graph, but more is permitted. The important thing is to show - either in the graph, or in text, or both - that you have thought about the logic of what you are visualising, how it shows the information and why this important You may find this helpful, a guide to different kinds of graphs and when they are appropriate, made by journalists at the Financial Times: A visual vocabulary 9.7 Check list Here are some questions to ask youself as you prepare your project do I care about this topic and/or data? do you have access to the raw data? can load it? if you can open it in a spreadsheet you will be definitely be able to open it in R, but you will still want to check if it is well formatted when you load it in R for example, if different cells have different amounts of information in your data won’t import nicely or, if you important information is contained in cell colours then this won’t be avaialble when you import into R Do you understand it? is there a code book? do you know what the columns are? do you understand the values? 9.8 Answers to common questions it doesn’t matter if you don’t do the things you said you wanted to do in the initial self-assessment you can use the data from another course, for example the course project (psy6009) the data / data questions doesn’t have to be something which expresses the relationship between two variables. Any visualisation which shows something non-trivial about the data is good. You don’t need to do any statistical tests or model fitting. You don’t need to have a set amount of data to meet statistical significance, just enough to be interesting when visualised. You don’t need more than a brief introduction to the data - no literature review please. This is a visualisation project, not an analysis project, so you don’t need to do statistical analysis. You will, however, find that a clear question or set of questions helps develop a good visualisation and/or that a good visualisation helps clarify an unclear question or set of questions. 9.9 Example Projects Here is an example small project which gives an idea of what I mean SuperTues: Published, repo 9.9.1 Stretch goals There hasn’t been time to do this this year, but in future years we will aim to build an interactive data visualisations using the Shiny package. Here’s one built for a research project I’m on : Power analyser "]
