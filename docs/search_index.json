See here for more on the different courses which offer data science, at the University of Sheffield These are placeholder pages. In 2020 most of this material was delivered offline. I am adding notes online as I can, so these pages in particular may evolve quickly 0.1 Motivation Psychological science is increasingly reliant on complex computational and statistical methods to make sense of rich behavioural data. This course aims to teach the skills which support creating robust and repoducibile analyses with such methods and data. As well as supporting sophisticated data visualisation, we aim to train you in reproducible workflows - meaning that you can reliably re-create all steps of an analysis using scripts that automate all steps between raw data and the final visualisation. As well as being reproducible (by you or other researchers) your work should be legible (to Future You, or other researchers) and scalable (it should work as well on 400,000 data points as on 40). You will need help to do this. Therefore you will use Open Source solutions - these are analysis products which have a worldwide community of people using them, and the infrastructure which supports sharing advice and solutions. In practice, this means you are going to start by using R (you could use Python, but this module is based on R). 0.2 Course Aims The curriculum is updated each year, but you can get the general idea of the order the topics are covered from the leftbar. By the end of this course you will have: Been trained in data project management – including fundamentals of data storage, syncronisation and sharing – and the importance of reproducible workflows Used the statistical programming language R, and RStudio, for data management, analysis and visualisation Been introduced to fundamental programming concepts Prepared data project documentation using RMarkdown Had an introduction to version control using git Published data projects to the web via github pages There is also the opportunity to cover advanced topics, either in class or as part of your project. These could include * Interactive visualisation with Shiny apps * SQL You may particularly enjoy the Reading list 0.2.1 The Final project The bulk of the course assessment is to conduct and publish your own analysis project. By doing this you will have experience of combining all the skills taught on the course within a singe project. This will take a data visualisation from start to finish - from raw data, through data cleaning and documentation to sharing your code and the resulting visualisation on the web. The intention with the assessment is to ensure that every student leaves the course with something they are proud to put in their portfolio of work, something which shows what they can do and which helps with future job or course applications.

Your aim is that when you come back to this project, or want to share it, everything you need is in one place and sensibly organised. Create subfolders for ‘data’, ‘graphs’, ‘notes’. Michael Frank’s onboarding guide explains a bit more about the logic of this. 4.2 Naming Things Files come in different types. This is indicated by their name, not the content.Turn on the options which means you file viewers the extensions of files (so you can see the full filename is MyProject.Doc not just MyProject). How to do this: PC, Mac. Because you will want to share this project use names that make sense to other people, as well as to you. MyProject.Doc is a bad name. joeblogs_psy64222.doc is better. Computers sometimes care about capitalisation, which means you need to pay attention : MyFile.doc and myfile.doc may not get treated the same. Computers also sometimes care about spaces in filenames. You can include these in your filenames and wait until this messes things up later (maybe much later, maybe even never), or you can decide now to be careful about capitalisation and never use spaces in your files names. Replace spaces with underscoress My File.doc becomes my_file.doc These rules also apply to variables in computer code. Jenny Bryan has good thoughts on Naming Things 4.3 Research Data Management Everything recorded during an experiment, whether by you or the computer, is data. All log files. Everything. Never delete any data. Never edit the raw data files. They should exist is a folder called or and only ever be opened, never modified in any way. All data should be backed-up automatically, as soon as it is collected. For how to do this, see the next header 4.4 Backup and Sync Any back up process which requires you to remember to deploy it is fragile. Use a cloud synchronisation service. Many are available, like OneDrive or Dropbox, but since you are in the University of Sheffield you should install the Google Drive Backup and Sync tool. As well as backing up your work to the cloud, this will allow you to work on multiple machines (because changes are automatically carried across from one to the other), as well as collaborate (because multiple people can add to the same shared folder and any changes are instantly available to the whole team). 4.5 Reading: Tidy Data organisation Habits and open data: Helping students develop a theory of scientific mind Broman &amp; Woo (2017) Data Organization in Spreadsheets University of Sheffield pages on Research Data Management "],["data-management.html", "Chapter 5 Data Management", " Chapter 5 Data Management Note this is a placeholder page.

The first is fundamental methods of making code do what you want - if statement, loops, functions. The second is fundamental principles of good code. Although we are using R, all programming languages use similar methods (although the exact syntax differs), and the principles of good code will also apply across languages. As well demonstrating these fundamentals, these pages also introduce the vocabulary used to discuss them. Knowing the vocabulary helps because it means you know what terms to use when searching for solutions to problems you have. 6.1 Fundamental methods if statements loops functions 6.1.1 If statements So far we have written simple scripts that do things in order, top to bottom a &lt;- 1 # define a variable a &lt;- a + 1 #add 1 print(a) # output the result ## [1] 2 The first block above is the code, the second block (the lines which start with ##) is the output. Changing which statements are run is called “flow control”. An “If statement” is a fundamental way of doing this. It allows us to specify one set statements to run if a certain conditions is met. For example a &lt;- 1 # define a variable a &lt;- a + 1 #add 1 if(a&gt;4) # this is the condition which has to be met, the &#39;test expression&#39; {print(a)} # this statement runs if the test expression is true Notice there is no output. Copy the code to your own computer and run it. Now change the first line to a &lt;- 9 and run it again. An If statement defines a branch in the flow of a script. The default can be nothing happening, but sometimes you want to define two alternatives. You can do this with an “If…else…statement” a &lt;- 1 # define a variable a &lt;- a + 1 #add 1 if(a&gt;4){ # this is the condition which has to be met, the &#39;test expression&#39; print(paste(a,&quot; is more than 4&quot;)) # this statement runs if the test expression is true } else { {print(paste(a,&quot; is equal or less than 4&quot;))} # this statement runs if the test expression is false } ## [1] &quot;2 is equal or less than 4&quot; You can actually have as many branches as you like, defining a series of test_expressions, like this type_of_thing &lt;- &#39;&#39; print(&quot;Is four a lot?&quot;) if (type_of_thing==&#39;Murders&#39;){ print(&quot;yes&quot;) } else if (type_of_thing==&#39;Dollars&#39;){ print(&quot;no&quot;) } else { print(&quot;Depends on the context&quot;) } ## [1] &quot;Is four a lot?&quot; ## [1] &quot;Depends on the context&quot; 6.1.2 Loops Loops repeat, either iterating over a set values, like this: for (i in 1:5){ print(i) } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 Or until some condition is met i &lt;- 1 #need to initialise a starting value while(i&lt;6){ print(i) i &lt;- i + 1 # increment the value of the counter } ## [1] 1 ## [1] 2 ## [1] 3 ## [1] 4 ## [1] 5 Note that this second version, a “while loop” uses a test expression just like an if statement Loops are useful wherever you might want to repeat some operation. years &lt;- 10 #how many years since you started saving savings &lt;-100 #how much you start with interest &lt;- 1.05 #rate of interest, ie 5% interest #Calculate using a loop for (year in 1:years){ savings&lt;-savings*interest } print(paste(&quot;After&quot;, years, &quot;years you will have £&quot;, round(savings,2))) #save more, kids ## [1] &quot;After 10 years you will have £ 162.89&quot; Lots of people advise against using loops because they are can be slow and it isn’t always obvious what they are doing. Alternatives often exist, like vectorisation: years &lt;- 20 #how many years since you started saving savings &lt;-100 #how much you start with interest &lt;- 1.05 #rate of interest, ie 5% interest #Calculate using a vector total_at_each_year=savings*interest**(1:years) #rather than a loop all the answer values are stored in a single vector #plot(total_at_each_year,xlab=&quot;years&quot;) #bonus! We can plot, since we now have all the intervening values saved The problem is, loops are the natural way to think about some problems. Often I first write my code with loops then, when I know what I really want to do I try and work out a way to do it with vectorisation. 6.1.3 Functions Functions take in values (called “arguments”), do something with them, and give a value or values back in return. You have already used functions, for example the mean function my_nums &lt;- c(78,12,32,24,03,89) #just a vector of some numbers mean(my_nums) #use the mean function to find the average ## [1] 39.66667 Functions always do the same thing, but give different results depending on the inputs (depending on the “arguments you pass to the function”). You can write your own functions, and then use them again and again (“call them again and again”). Here is the general form of a function myfunctionname &lt;- function(input_value) { # comment line helpfully explaining what the function does output_value &lt;- input_value #lines of code which do something to the input to produce the output return(output_value) } Note a couple of things: when you run this code it does not produce any output, but a new object appears in the “global environment” window, top right. Like a variable, your function is now stored in the memory of the current R session. You can call this function now. If you close R you’ll need to define the function again by running the above code again (other functions are inbuilt, like mean and are loaded at startup, or when you use the library command to load a set of functions). Now, when we call the function, we pass actual values. myfunctionname(3) ## [1] 3 Let’s make our a slightly more complicated outcheck &lt;- function(val,threshold) { # outlier checker if(val&lt;threshold){ output_value &lt;- val #if value is below theshold return that value } else { output_value &lt;- NA #otherwise, return NaN } return(output_value) } This function takes two input values, and returns a single value which depends on the relation between the two outcheck(3,5) ## [1] 3 outcheck(7,5) ## [1] NA 6.1.3.1 A note about scope Variables within functions are kept ‘inside’ the functions (within the “scope” of the function). Once you pass a value to a function is acquires the label set in the function definition. Variables defined within the function don’t persist outside of it (they don’t affect the “global environment”) So, for example, it doesn’t matter if you have another variable called threshold, the threshold within the function is set by the second value passed it. Like this: threshold &lt;- 100 outcheck(7,5) #returns NA because 7 is higher than 5 ## [1] NA 6.1.4 Exercises Write an if…else statement that prints “ODD” if the number is odd, “EVEN” if the number is even (hint: you might use the remainder function %% (try 4%%2 to see how much is left when you divide 4 by 2) Write a loop which goes from 10 to 20 in steps of 3 Write a function which prints “FIZZ” if a number is divisible by 3, and “BUZZ” if it is divisible by 5 and “FIZZBUZZ” if it is divisble by 3 and 5 Write a loop which counts from 1 to 100 and applies the fizzbuzz function to each number 6.1.5 More Lisa DeBruine, &amp; Dale Barr.

Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3564555: Iterations &amp; Functions datamentor.io on Flow control 6.2 Fundamental principles of good code 6.2.1 Readability Matters Your most important collaborator is you from six months ago, and they don’t answer email. Good code doesn’t just work, it is easy to understand. This supports the code being checked for errors, modified and improved (by you as well as by other people). To support this you should make your code readable. This means commenting your code, but also laying it out nicely, and using sensible names for variables and function. The aim is to make the code explain itself, as well as doing something. Someone who reads your code - a future you maybe, or a collaborator - needs to be able to run the code, yes, but they also need to know what you are doing and why you are doing. Look at this function, it hard to understand, right? pf &lt;- function(n){ p=1 ; if (n&gt;1){ i = 2; while( (i&lt;(n/2+1)) &amp; (p==1) ) {if (n%%i ==0) p=0; i=i+1 } } else {p=0 }; return(p) } This kind of code is very compressed. You can fit a lot in a few lines, but it is useless because nobody else will understand it, and probably the person who wrote it won’t understand it when they come back to it (and that means they will miss any bugs, or will find it hard to improve or repurpose). Readability is improved a lot by adding some spacing and tabs. Have another go at figuring out what the code does: pf &lt;- function(n){ p=1 if (n&gt;1){ i = 2 while( (i&lt;(n/2+1)) &amp; (p==1) ) { if (n%%i ==0) { p=0 } i=i+1 } } else { p=0 } return(p) } Now we make the variable and function names sensible: primecheck &lt;- function(num){ isprime=TRUE if (num&gt;1){ i = 2 while( (i&lt;(num/2+1)) &amp; (isprime==TRUE) ) { if (num%%i ==0) { isprime=FALSE } i=i+1 } } else { isprime=FALSE } return(isprime) } Can you tell what it does yet? Now fully commented primecheck &lt;- function(num){ #check if a number is prime # - assumes the number provided is an integer # - works by working through all possible divisors up to half the test number, checking if the remainer is 0 # isprime=TRUE # a flag, which tracks if we think the number is prime. We start out assuming our number *is* prime # first we only need to do the complicated method for numbers great than 1 if (num&gt;1){ i = 2 #a counter, starting at 2 (because all numbers divide by 1) #use while loop to check all divisors until we&#39;ve done them all or we find one (and confirm the number is not prime) while( (i&lt;(num/2+1)) &amp; (isprime==TRUE) ) { if (num%%i ==0) { #if the number divides by another number with no remainder it can&#39;t be prime, so we change the flag isprime=FALSE } i=i+1 # increment the counter, so we work through all possible divisors } } else { # if the number is 1 or lower it can&#39;t be prime, so we change the flag isprime=FALSE } return(isprime) #return the flag as the output of the function, 0 -&gt; not prime, 1 -&gt; prime } It is possible to comment too much. The code above I commented so someone who wasn’t an experienced programmer could read the comments and it would help them understand how the code worked (you can tell me if I succeeded). Usually a few fewer comments might make the code easier to read, with the assumption that anyone reading it has a bit of experience with the coding language. Like this primecheck &lt;- function(num){ #check if a number is prime # - assumes input is integer isprime=TRUE # a flag, start assuming our number *is* prime # only check numbers &gt; 1 if (num&gt;1){ i = 2 #a counter #check all divisors until we&#39;ve done them all or we find one while( (i&lt;(num/2+1)) &amp; (isprime==TRUE) ) { if (num%%i ==0) { #no remainder -&gt; number isn&#39;t prime isprime=FALSE } i=i+1 # increment the counter } } else { # if the number is 1 or lower it can&#39;t be prime isprime=FALSE } return(isprime) } This version is 22 lines rather than 1, but I hope you agree it is easier to work with. There’s no shortage of space in R scripts, so if in doubt, put some effort in to laying things out nicely, use sensible names for variable functions and add comments. You’ll thank yourself when you come back to your code (which you will always have to). 6.2.2 Avoid hard coded values Say you were going to load some data, you could do this: mydata = read.csv(&#39;/home/tom/Desktop/psy6422/mydatafile.csv&#39;) Now this happens to work on my computer, but it won’t on yours. The reason it won’t work isn’t because there is a bug in how i’m loading data, just that you don’t have a file in the same place as I do. Far better, for both readability and debugging if you seperate out values that might change from the commands that use them. Like this: datafile = &#39;/home/tom/Desktop/psy6422/mydatafile.csv&#39; mydata = read.csv(datafile) Now the second line is easier to read, and you also have a variable which you can reuse. For example maybe later in your script you want to save the name of the raw data file somewhere. You can just use: label = paste(&#39;This plot generated using data from &#39;, datafile) And when you use the same script for different data, both the lines loading data and recording the data file are correct. Another example graph1 &lt;- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x1, y=y1)) graph1 + geom_point(color=&#39;blue&#39;,size=3) #change this line for different look graph2 &lt;- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x2, y=y2)) graph2 + geom_point(color=&#39;blue&#39;,size=3) #change this line for different look Adding variables means you only need to edit one line to change the look of both plots pointcolour=&#39;red&#39;; pointsize=5 ; pointshape = 23 #change this line for different look graph1 &lt;- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x1, y=y1)) graph1 + geom_point(color=pointcolour,size=pointsize, shape = pointshape) # never change these lines graph2 &lt;- ggplot(data = anscombe, mapping = aes(x = x2, y=y2)) graph2 + geom_point(color=pointcolour,size=pointsize, shape = pointshape) # never change these lines This may seem minor, but as your code gets longer developing habits like this will save you time, and make your code easier to work with. 6.2.3 Functionalise &amp; Generalise If you ever find yourself using very similar lines of code, you should think about making a function. Functions make your code shorter and easier to read (and write), and they make it way easier to update (because when you catch a bug you can just update the code in the function, rather than every time you repeated those lines). Functions are also an opportunity to think to yourself “what is the most general purpose way of doing what I’m doing”. Thinking like this will help you develop powerful, flexible, code which you can use to do multiple things. Let’s look at a toy example: mynumbers = c(2,3,4) #double and add one to each number mynumbers[1] &lt;- mynumbers[1]*2+1 # line 1 mynumbers[2] &lt;- mynumbers[2]*2+1 # line 2 mynumbers[3] &lt;- mynumbers[3]*2+1 # line 3 print(mynumbers) ## [1] 5 7 9 This can be improved with a function myfunc &lt;- function(num){ #toy function, doubles and adds 1 return(num*2+1) } mynumbers = c(2,3,4) mynumbers &lt;- myfunc(mynumbers) # all the work with 1 line! print(mynumbers) ## [1] 5 7 9 This code is easier to read, easier to change, and you can write new code which uses this function again. 6.2.4 Ask for help Nobody finds this easy straight away. Learning how to find help a core programming skill (along with not giving up when it feels like you are completely stuck). Part of this is knowing how programming people talk about stuff so you can search effectively for solutions. If you get an error message, copy and paste it into your search. If you are really stuck, just trying to descibe you problem is a good way of indentifying exactly what you want to do, and why you can’t. When you’ve described your problem full - see this How to make a great R reproducible example and this How do I ask a good question? - you can ask a friend or post it to a forum. If you’re on this module you can post it to Slack on the r-coding channel, or if not try seeking out R groups in your city or institution.

Comments are good for making code readable, but often you will want longer sections of text, mixed in with both the code you are running and the outputs of the code (e.g. the plots you are making with it). Do this with Rmarkdown. A Rmarkdown file is a plain text file, like a R script, but with the extension .Rmd rather than .R. You can make one now in RStudio by clicking File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown. Or by saving an existing .R script as filename.Rmd. RMarkdown is the system which marks how text should look after it has been converted into a webpage, or PDF, or some other kind of document. The name RMarkdown is kind of a joke, since RMarkdown is a version of a “markup langauge”. Markups are the opposite of the WYSIWYG systems (like MS word or Google Docs) which you are used to. These pages are written in Rmarkdown. You can see this individual file here in the online repositry. It will really help if you read the webpage alongside the file, so you can compare the file which generates the text, using the markdown, and the output (the webpage). Rstudio magic (called “rendering” or “knitting”) turns this file in to the webpage. Before you can turn your .Rmd files into PDF you need to install TeX on your machine: use this download link Compare the file and the webpage. In the webpage this line is in bold. Why? In the webpage this line is in italic. Why? 7.1 And this line is a heading Try now creating your own Rmarkdown file by clicking File &gt; New File &gt; Rmarkdown in RStudio. RMarkdown files have three components. 7.2 First a header Aka “header material”. It looks like this, at the top of the file: Yaml matter at the top of a .Rmd file This is called YAML and it is stuff meant to be read by the computer when the file is converted into a document to be read by humans. You can see that this is meant to be an “HTML” document (that’s the kind on a webpage), so let’s make it now. Click “knit” in RStudio (or “knit to HTML” if you are exploring the options menu). (you’ll be prompted to give your .Rmd file a name first, if you haven’t done this already). After a brief pause you should get a new window open, containing something that has some of the same words as your document. Notice how the YAML stuff has disappeared, and the new document now contains formatting (bold, italics, headings, etc). Part of the benefit of markdown is that you write the document once, and can convert it to a webpage, or a PDF, or a MS Word document. Try now. Click “Knit” and select “Knit to PDF”. You get a nice PDF document, looking almost, but not entirely, like the webspage you made moments before. 7.3 Second, text If you just write stuff in a .Rmd document you get text. This is the second kind of thing in a .Rmd document, like this. It can contain formatting - italics, bold, etc - as well as stuff like lists and hyperlinks: See the formatting options in this cheatsheet This line just to demonstrate that this is a list But the real strength of Rmarkdown is you can mix text and code 7.4 Third, code This is the third ingredient, code and any output it produces. Like this: print(&quot;Here is some R code&quot;) a &lt;- 6 b &lt;- 2.3 print(a/b) print(&quot;And the output it produces&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Here is some R code&quot; ## [1] 2.608696 ## [1] &quot;And the output it produces&quot; Here is another example #Code to make an example graph library(tidyverse) #load some data filename &lt;- &#39;/home/tom/Desktop/psy6422/mydatafile.csv&#39; df &lt;- read.csv(filename) #rename columns for easy labelling df &lt;- df %&gt;% rename(ppt = Participant.Number,asrs = Total.ASRS.Score) #plot parameters plottitle &lt;- &#39;ASRS values for each participant&#39; xlab &lt;- &#39;Participant number&#39; ylab &lt;- &#39;Total ASRS score&#39; pointsize &lt;- 7 #make plot p1 &lt;- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=ppt,y=asrs)) p1 + geom_point(size=pointsize) + ggtitle(plottitle) + xlab(xlab) + ylab(ylab) You don’t need to show the r code, but can still include it in the document and use it to generate figures etc. The scatterplot above uses participant number as one of the axes, which doesn’t really make any sense. A histogram is a better way of visualising the spread of scores on a single variable, so here is one: The code to make this plot is contained in the same .Rmd file as this text, but I’ve hidden it so only the output is shown. To do this I set echo = FALSE for the r chunk in the .Rmd file. You’ll have to look at the source file to see this, because - obviously! - in the webpage you don’t see any code. You can also put single values in ongoing text using Rmarkdown Imagine you have some data data = c(10,42,2,2,34,63) You can then refer to it in the text. Like this: the mean of the data is 25.5 If you are viewing on the webpage you see the answer, but the file contains an instruction to calculate mean(data). Neat, eh? 7.5 Conclusion Rmarkdown documents give you a powerful way to combine text, code and code outputs in one file. That means you don’t lose track of how graphs are generated, or statistics are calculated. With RMarkdown your workflow is reproducible, so if you add new data you can update the final report with just one click. RMarkdown documents also encourage you to document fully and explain your code. You can export to different formats depending on your audience, all from the same file. 7.6 Exercises Create a new RMarkdown document Describe in text the data you are thinking of using for your assignment. Use some highlights: bold, italics Use headings Include an R chunk importing the data and showing the first few lines of the data Include some more text describing the key variables you are interested in Show a graph of something (either a scatterplot, or a histogram perhaps) Include some inline text, reporting a mean value (as my last example above) Make PDF and a Word file by clicking “knit” Email Send the .Rmd file *and the PDF to me via a Slack direct message 7.7 Resources RStudio intro to Rmarkdown RStudio RMarkdown cheatsheet Helps with learning Markdown conventions: markdownlivepreview.com Making Word documents: Happy collaboration with Rmd to docx Install this to make PDFs work: Getting MiKTeX "],["git-and-github.html", "Chapter 8 Git and Github 8.1 Before the class 8.2 Accessing git 8.3 Resources for the class 8.4 Exercise - publishing your project with github pages 8.5 Bonus Reading", " Chapter 8 Git and Github With our guest lecturer, Seb James Note this is a placeholder page.

The final project is a chance to deploy all the skills taught on the course in a single complete data visualations project, which takes us from raw data and a question through data preparation and exploration through to publishing a visualisation and the documentation which shares your findings with others. 10.4 Project requirements A complete project, including raw data, analysis scripts, documentation and visualisations shared in a way that allows the visualisation to be reproduced and understood In practice, this means you should upload a project to github, containing a Rmarkdown file which explains your visualisation, as taught in the module (although alternatives are acceptable if they meet the primary criteria). Please include these headings, or something similar, in your project. Data Origins Answering questions of where it comes from, how it was collected, what the variables mean, etc show the first few rows of the raw data, if possible Research Questions in plain english, a simple statement of what question(s) your visulisation will attempt to address Data Preparation steps taken to clean the data, exclude outliers, create summary statistics, grouped variables, etc show the first few rows of the processed data, if possible showing the code which does this were relevant Visualisation(s) graph or graphs documentation explaining any motivation (although good graph labelling is better than explanation in the accompanying text) code for producing them Summary Brief thoughts on what you have learnt, what you might do next if you had more time / more data The ultimate aim is to make something that looks good and shows off your abilities. You want to produce something you are proud to show people (including future employers and supervisors) 10.5 Choosing your data The data is an excuse for the data visualisation, so don’t agonise over this, and go for simple over complex if you have a choice. I recommend you find a data set with variables which you understand. The lecture on March 19th covered how to find open data. 10.5.1 Finding Data I will update these notes soon, but basically many papers are now published accommpanied by open data. Sometimes this is indicated by an Open Data Badge. For example, take a look at the current table of contents for Psychological Science. The badges are an initiative of the Centre for Open Science https://cos.io/our-services/open-science-badges/ You can also search a preprint archive such as psyarxiv. Many, but not all, papers published as preprints will have open data. You can also search OSF.io directly. Pick a topic and have a look at what is available The other route is large publicly available resources: such as Our World in Data. Another good source of diverse, open and current data sets is the Data Is Plural newsletter Enjoy this crowdsourced list of Open psychological datasets Kaggle 10.5.2 Suggestions for 2021 (in progress) These are examples of large, probably messy, real-world data sets which could make good starting points for projects: freeCodeCamp.org survey of new programmers StackOverFlow survey data BEHACOM - a dataset modelling users’ behaviour in computers The World Values Survey “is the largest non-commercial, cross-national, time series investigation of human beliefs and values ever executed, currently including interviews with almost 400,000 respondents.” 10.6 Choose your graph You only need to draw one graph, but more are permitted. The important thing is to show - either in the graph, or in text, or both - that you have thought about the logic of what you are visualising, how it shows the information and why this important You may find this helpful, a guide to different kinds of graphs and when they are appropriate, made by journalists at the Financial Times: A visual vocabulary 10.7 Check list Here are some questions to ask youself as you prepare your project do I care about this topic and/or data? do you have access to the raw data? can you load it? if you can open it in a spreadsheet you will be definitely be able to open it in R, but you will still want to check if it is well formatted when you load it in R for example, if different cells have different amounts of information in your data won’t import nicely or, if you important information is contained in cell colours then this won’t be available when you import into R Do you understand it? is there a code book? do you know what the columns are? do you understand the values? 10.8 Answers to common questions it doesn’t matter if you don’t do the things you said you wanted to do in the initial self-assessment you can use the data from another course, for example the course project (psy6009) the data / data questions doesn’t have to be something which expresses the relationship between two variables. Any visualisation which shows something non-trivial about the data is good. You don’t need to do any statistical tests or model fitting. You don’t need to have a set amount of data to meet statistical significance, just enough to be interesting when visualised. You don’t need more than a brief introduction to the data - no literature review please. This is a visualisation project, not an analysis project, so you don’t need to do statistical analysis. You will, however, find that a clear question or set of questions helps develop a good visualisation and/or that a good visualisation helps clarify an unclear question or set of questions. There is no word limit, but remember - for a project which has maximum impact short is sweet (i.e. try and show off quality of work without quantity of text) 10.9 Getting help Simple questions should be posted on slack, ideally in the appropriate channel. This means that any advice you get (or give) is shared with the whole class, so everyone can benefit and we avoid needlessly repeating the same mistakes as individuals. For more complex problems, you will want to share your whole project - this means not just the R or Rmd file you are working on, but the data file(s) as well, as well as an auxillary notes. Please create a folder, following the project organisation scheme we covered in week 1 with subfolders for the data, figures, etc and including the .Rmd file. Share this with me and I can help. You can either share a google drive folder or a github repo. Doing this means I have all the parts required to reproduce your issue. It also means that if you update your project in between contacting me and me looking at it then I see the very latest version, rather than working on an outdated problem. Note that the deadline for assignments is the after the weekend, so I will not be answering questions in the days immediately before the deadline. If you want to ensure an answer to your question please ask it so here is at least one full working day before the deadline (i.e. if the deadline is after the Weekend, please ask by 5pm on the thursday). 10.10 Example Projects Here is an example small project which gives an idea of what I mean SuperTues: Published, repo Class of 2020 projects. ### Stretch goals There hasn’t been time to do this this year, but in future years we will aim to build an interactive data visualisations using the Shiny package.

It is easiest for me to help you with your project, either in person (see timetable) or by email if you provide a full project (e.g. the data and code as well as the output you have so far) as well as a project rationale stating what it is you are trying to do This is helpful guidance on posing specific coding questions https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask A.2 Terminology: ‘Raw data’ Data before any processing has been done. Usually these means that the individual responses which create the data are recorded The opposite is cleaned data (once it has been processed) and then after that summary data (in which responses are collapsed across individuals or into groups) ##. What should I do if my visualisation uses a new library or package? Ideally your code should specify all the libraries it uses. These are known as “dependencies”. If you use an usual library it may require specific downloading to your computer, meaning that your code won’t run on computers that don’t have it downloaded. There are ways of managing this, but we haven’t covered these in the course (google “docker” or “conda” or “reproducible computational environments”).

C.3 Python This course teaches general principles of coding and computation, and specific skills for data management and visualisation in R. Lots of people in the data science world, particularly in areas which align with computer science / machine learning, use Python. I decided to teach this course in R because the community around a language is as important as the language. You can do anything in any language, and most things as easily in Python as in R, but Psychologists, biologists and scholars from across the social sciences tend to use R, so I’m teaching this course in R.

C.5 Data Science @ Sheffield The MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science, of which this module is a core part, is designed to teach graduate psychologists data science skills. If you don’t have a psychology background our other MSc courses in cognitive neuroscience can operate as “conversion courses”, since they are designed to teach core psychology/neuroscience skills to people from non-psychology backgrounds. Our MSc is not the only way you can study data science at the University of Sheffield. The MSc in Data Analytics is taught in the Department of Computer Science and has a stronger focus on computational tools such as machine learning. The MSc in Data Science is in the Information School which is in the Faculty of Social Science, and has more of a focus on business decisions and using data in organisations. We also highly recommend the MSc in Social Research, run by the Sheffield Methods Institute, which teaches a full suite of quantative and qualatative research skills. The SMI is also home to the Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training which offers opportunities to undertake a 4-year funded integrated MSc and PhD. C.6 Careers Inside or outside of research, data management and visualisation skills will be good for your career. Unlike many high-technical skills, coding is highly accessible. Even in the world of software development, over half of programmers are self-taught. But coding is relevant to more than just pure software jobs, one report found that 20% of graduate-level jobs value coding as a skill, and these jobs paid on average 30% more than other graduate jobs.

"],["class-of-2020.html", "D Class of 2020 D.1 Feedback", " D Class of 2020 This was the first year for the new MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science. PSY6422 is a key module for this course, and is designed to set students up for their independent data science project, completed over the summer. Before they work on their summer projects, MSc students complete a mini-project on this module, and these are what is showcased below. Most students came into this module with little or no previous experience of coding. The aim is to share powerful, flexible, computational methods which allow the production of reproducible analyses and useful data visualisations. The module is taught via workshops, and the end point is to carry out and publish a data analysis and visualisation on a data set which interests you. The class of 2020 was impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, which led to some classes being cancelled and the rest being moved online mid-module. Here just a few examples of data visualisations produced by the class for their data mini-projects. Each project was different, and each student published their data, analysis code and visualisation as an online notebook (so please click the link for more details of each project). Hala took open data from Sheffield city council and showed daily cycles in air pollution levels Note the spikes in N02 levels during the morning and evening rush hours. Nabiha looked at Students’ Performance in Exams Note that these boxplots with jittered points allow you to see the group average but also the underlying data. Rachel, looked at COVID-19 Deaths in England and produced a number of animated and interactive plots which really show off the data visualisation potential of R/ggplot, including this shocking plot of regional rates of death against deprivation, which shows that the death rate in the most deprived areas was twice that of the rate in the least deprived areas. Hover over each bar for details. Yidan’s project mixed python and R and involved some highly technical work installing and querying an SQL database server. The topic, Skill acquisition of solo players: a case study revealed how practice mapped to skill level in players of an online strategy game: This is the famous learning curve, showing that players improved with practice (but at a deccelerating rate). My unofficial prize for aesthetics in data visualisation went to Katie’s project avocado prices, sales &amp; distribution across the US between 2015-2018 which used a consistent, and avocado-themed, colour scheme throughout: Adam’s project is a good illustration of the power of data visualisation - it can make salient something we might know but had not fully reckoned with. In his case, his project was on Changes in average house prices and incomes in England 1997-2019: His graph of the change in the ratio of average house price to average income shows just how unaffordable housing has become. Several projects looked at topics which interested the students and for which public data was available. For example, Victoria looked at the World Happiness Report 2019 data, (another) Katie looked at Caffeine Intake and Mental Health, and Eleanor looked at Professional CS:GO Matches and in particular at the performance of a professional team based in Sheffield. Others projects used open data from published research, replicating and extending the analysis the original authors reproduced (Bessie, Esra, Sam, Leah) These are just the projects which were completed and published publicly by students on the module this year (and who gave me permission to link to their work). I am immensely proud of all the work students did on this module, which was severely disrupted by the pandemic. However far you get with data analysis and visualisation there is always more you can learn, which can be daunting, but it can also be exciting because there are new things to try, new data to look and new things to find out. Tom Stafford, July 2020 D.1 Feedback Selected feedback from the class of 2020 .alpha { text-align: right; color: darkblue; font-style: italic; padding-bottom: 15px; } .beta { text-align: left; color: green; font-style: italic; padding-bottom: 15px; } Coming from someone who has never coded before, I thoroughly enjoyed visualising data. I never thought I would be someone who would enjoy looking at data, but I found it but both useful and interesting to create graphs that visualise the data in a more digestible form. Since I’ve never done coding to do anything before and I’ve only used point and click methods this is an obvious advantage of doing things this way so you can see where you went wrong and easily change it without having to start over again. I have actually found myself enjoying a topic that I was convinced that I was going to hate, so for that I am thankful. The topic I found most useful and interesting was the RMarkdown topic. I was initally extremely skeptical about this topic, my exact thoughts were; why would anyone use RMarkdown when Microsoft Word is available? I have since come to understand my naivety and learnt RMarkdown is an incredibly useful tool, which bridges the computational functionality of R with the ability to annotate code and create a running commentary of the analysis - amazing! Before this module I had heard of R but not really understood its purpose or usefulness. I had assumed it was similar to SPSS, oh how wrong I was. Very rewarding. I am immensely proud of my visualisation project I am oddly grateful for the struggles I experienced as I feel I have really got a sense of accomplishment out of completing the module. Before starting this Msc I’d have laughed at the idea of even understanding anything to do with coding or visualisation, but now I genuinely have an interest in it. I found the topics of constructing and publishing projects in a reproducible way and via an open platform really interesting. I also found learning how to handle data and construct graphs in R very useful as I have never manipulated data using coding, and it was interesting to learn how you can keep track of your working and avoid simple errors this way. Finding yourself in completely disarray when trying to solve an unsolvable coding problem, but feeling like an absolute genius when said unsolvable problem is solved was very satisfying. Thanks for the detailed feedback on our Data Visualisation projects! It was very thorough, some of the best feedback I’ve ever received while at university!! "]]
