Stretch goals: Unfortunately we won't have time this year for a number of advanced topics which I would like to cover. Hopefully next year: Jupyter notebooks The terminal / ssh Interactive visualisation with Shiny apps SQL 0.3 Example Projects The bulk of the assessment is to conduct and publish your own analysis project. Here is an example small project which gives an idea of what I mean SuperTues: Published, repo Stretch goal is to build an interactive data visualisation using Shiny Here's one I built earlier Power analyser "],

Lots of people in the data science world, particular in areas which align with computer science / machine learning, use Python. I decided to teach this course in R because the community around a language is as important as the language. You can do anything in any language, and most things as easily in Python as in R, but Psychologists, biologists and scholars from across the social scientists tend to use R, so I'm teaching this course in R If you want to learn Python, I recommend Book: Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas Book: Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney Pages: chrisalbon.com A.10 General righteousness You should use a password manager. Really. LastPass is recommended You should know how to use a VPN Advice for Sheffield students here: Working remotely - information for students You can test by visiting this page. If you are in the University network (either on campus or via a VPN) it will offer you the chance to download the article PDF. Otherwise it will try and charge you $35 for the privelege.
