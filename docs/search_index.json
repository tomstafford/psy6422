Comments are good for making code readable, but often you will want longer sections of text, mixed in with both the code you are running and the outputs of the code (e.g. the plots you are making with it). Do this with Rmarkdown. A Rmarkdown file is a plain text file, like a R script, but with the extension .Rmd rather than .R. You can make one now in RStudio by clicking File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown. Or by saving an existing .R script as filename.Rmd. RMarkdown is the system which marks how text should look after it has been converted into a webpage, or PDF, or some other kind of document. The name RMarkdown is kind of a joke, since RMarkdown is a version of a “markup langauge.” Markups are the opposite of the WYSIWYG systems (like MS word or Google Docs) which you are used to. These pages are written in Rmarkdown. You can see this individual file here in the online repositry. It will really help if you read the webpage alongside the file, so you can compare the file which generates the text, using the markdown, and the output (the webpage). Rstudio magic (called “rendering” or “knitting”) turns this file in to the webpage. Before you can turn your .Rmd files into PDF you need to install TeX on your machine: use this download link Compare the file and the webpage. In the webpage this line is in bold. Why? In the webpage this line is in italic. Why? 7.1 And this line is a heading Try now creating your own Rmarkdown file by clicking File &gt; New File &gt; Rmarkdown in RStudio. RMarkdown files have three components. 7.2 First a header Aka “header material.” It looks like this, at the top of the file: Yaml matter at the top of a .Rmd file This is called YAML and it is stuff meant to be read by the computer when the file is converted into a document to be read by humans. You can see that this is meant to be an “HTML” document (that’s the kind on a webpage), so let’s make it now. Click “knit” in RStudio (or “knit to HTML” if you are exploring the options menu). (you’ll be prompted to give your .Rmd file a name first, if you haven’t done this already). After a brief pause you should get a new window open, containing something that has some of the same words as your document. Notice how the YAML stuff has disappeared, and the new document now contains formatting (bold, italics, headings, etc). Part of the benefit of markdown is that you write the document once, and can convert it to a webpage, or a PDF, or a MS Word document. Try now. Click “Knit” and select “Knit to PDF.” You get a nice PDF document, looking almost, but not entirely, like the webspage you made moments before. 7.3 Second, text If you just write stuff in a .Rmd document you get text. This is the second kind of thing in a .Rmd document, like this. It can contain formatting - italics, bold, etc - as well as stuff like lists and hyperlinks: See a long list of formatting options in this cheatsheet The most common options here: Markdown Basics This line just to demonstrate that this is a list But the real strength of Rmarkdown is you can mix text and code 7.4 Third, code This is the third ingredient, code and any output it produces. Like this: print(&quot;Here is some R code&quot;) a &lt;- 6 b &lt;- 2.3 print(a/b) print(&quot;And the output it produces&quot;) ## [1] &quot;Here is some R code&quot; ## [1] 2.608696 ## [1] &quot;And the output it produces&quot; Here is another example #Code to make an example graph library(tidyverse) #load some data #Methdod 1. Load from Tom&#39;s computer #filename &lt;- &#39;/home/tom/Desktop/psy6422/mydatafile.csv&#39; #df &lt;- read.csv(filename) #Method 2. Load from URL https://rpubs.com/lokraj/github_csv library (readr) urlfile=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomstafford/psy6422/master/mydatafile.csv&quot; df &lt;- read_csv(url(urlfile)) ## ## ── Column specification ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## `Participant Number` = col_double(), ## `Total ASRS Score` = col_double(), ## `Inattention subscale` = col_double(), ## `Hyperactivity subscale` = col_double() ## ) #rename columns for easy labelling df &lt;- df %&gt;% rename(ppt = &quot;Participant Number&quot;,asrs = &quot;Total ASRS Score&quot;) #plot parameters plottitle &lt;- &#39;ASRS values for each participant&#39; xlab &lt;- &#39;Participant number&#39; ylab &lt;- &#39;Total ASRS score&#39; pointsize &lt;- 7 #make plot p1 &lt;- ggplot(data=df,aes(x=ppt,y=asrs)) p1 + geom_point(size=pointsize) + ggtitle(plottitle) + xlab(xlab) + ylab(ylab) You don’t need to show the r code, but can still include it in the document and use it to generate figures etc. The scatterplot above uses participant number as one of the axes, which doesn’t really make any sense. A histogram is a better way of visualising the spread of scores on a single variable, so here is one: The code to make this plot is contained in the same .Rmd file as this text, but I’ve hidden it so only the output is shown. To do this I set echo = FALSE for the r chunk in the .Rmd file. You’ll have to look at the source file to see this, because - obviously! - in the webpage you don’t see any code. 7.4.1 Options for code chunks Other options for code chunks include include = FALSE makes the code and results invisible, but the code still runs message = FALSE hides messages generated by the code warning = FALSE hides error messages and warnings (normally you want to pay attention to these, but they can make your final document untidy) fig.cap = \"...\" puts a caption on any visualisation output 7.4.2 Include r in inline text You can also put single values in ongoing text using Rmarkdown Imagine you have some data data = c(10,42,2,2,34,63) You can then refer to it in the text. Like this: the mean of the data is 25.5 If you are viewing on the webpage you see the answer, but the file contains an instruction to calculate mean(data). Neat, eh? 7.5 Conclusion Rmarkdown documents give you a powerful way to combine text, code and code outputs in one file. That means you don’t lose track of how graphs are generated, or statistics are calculated. With RMarkdown your workflow is reproducible, so if you add new data you can update the final report with just one click. RMarkdown documents also encourage you to document fully and explain your code. You can export to different formats depending on your audience, all from the same file. 7.6 Exercises Create a new RMarkdown document Describe in text the data you are thinking of using for your assignment. Use some highlights: bold, italics Use headings Include an R chunk importing the data and showing the first few lines of the data (hint: use the head command) Include some more text describing the key variables you are interested in Show a graph of something (either a scatterplot, or a histogram perhaps) Include some inline text, reporting a mean value (as my last example above) Make PDF and a Word file by clicking “knit” Send the .Rmd file *and the PDF to me via a Slack direct message Using RMarkdown is essential on this course. These exercises help you check you have mastered this material, as well as giving another opportunity for Tom to feed back on your project 7.7 Advanced Set the html output options in the YAML to make your output look nicer --- title: &quot;Habits&quot; output: df_print: &#39;paged&#39; code_folding: &#39;show&#39; number_sections: true --- 7.8 Checklist Create RMarkdown documents Knit to HTML, Word and/or PDF Incorporate text formatting like bold, italics, headings and hyperlinks Incorporate inline R code (e.g. to report variable values) Incorporate code chunks understand that these can be defined with names and/or options use the echo=FALSE to not show code chunks Incorporate graphical output 7.9 Resources RStudio intro to Rmarkdown Xie et al (2021): R Markdown: The Definitive Guide RStudio RMarkdown cheatsheet Getting started in R markdown Helps with learning Markdown conventions: markdownlivepreview.com Making Word documents: Happy collaboration with Rmd to docx Install this to make PDFs work: Getting MiKTeX You can write beautifully APA formatted manuscripts in RMarkdown: A minimal example of APA manuscript preparation, integrating text &amp; analysis code, using Rmarkdown and papaja "]]
