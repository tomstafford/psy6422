# Notes

## Credit

These pages based on [a template](https://psyteachr.github.io/book-template/) published by the awesome [psyTeachR team](https://psyteachr.github.io/about/). Extra thanks to Lisa DeBruine for help.

## Colophon

Everything worked better when I:

* set GitHub pages to run off of Master/docs
* listened to Lisa and used bookdown at the CL, not knit in Rstudio, to render the pages: ``R -e 'bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd")'``
* installed [R 3.6](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu/README.html)
* installed tidyverse, bookdown, devtools and finally [Webex](https://github.com/PsyTeachR/webex).

## Python

This course teaches general principles of coding and computation, and specific skills for data management and visualisation in R. Lots of people in the data science world, particularly in areas which align with computer science / machine learning, use Python.

I decided to teach this course in R because the community around a language is as important as the language. You can do anything in any language, and most things as easily in Python as in R, but Psychologists, biologists and scholars from across the social sciences tend to use R, so I'm teaching this course in R.

If you want to learn Python, I recommend:

* Pages [RealPython: Learn Python Programming, By Example](https://realpython.com/start-here/)
* Book: [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas

* Pages: [chrisalbon.com](https://chrisalbon.com/)
* Pages: [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com), for example this one [A Quick Introduction to the “Pandas” Python Library](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-quick-introduction-to-the-pandas-python-library-f1b678f34673)
* Book: [Python for Experimental Psychologists](http://www.pygaze.org/pep/) by Edwin Dalmaijer

## General righteousness

You should use a password manager. Really. [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com) is recommended

You should know how to use a VPN

* You can test by visiting [this page](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797613511466). If you are in the University network (either on campus or via a VPN) it will offer you the chance to download the article PDF. Otherwise it will try and charge you $35 for the privilege.

## Data Science @ Sheffield

The [MSc in Psychological Research Methods with Data Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/prospectivepg/masters/data-science) is designed to teach graduate psychologists data science skills. If you don't have a psychology background our other [MSc courses in cognitive neuroscience](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/psychology/prospectivepg/masters) can operate as "conversion courses", since they are designed to teach core psychology/neuroscience skills to people from non-psychology backgrounds.

Our MSc is not the only way you can study data science at the University of Sheffield. The [MSc in Data Analytics](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2020/data-analytics-msc) is taught in the Department of Computer Science and has a stronger focus on computational tools such as machine learning. The [MSc in Data Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2020/data-science-msc) is in the Information School which is in the Faculty of Social Science, and has more of a focus on business decisions and using data in organisations. We also highly recommend the [MSc in Social Research](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/courses/2020/social-research-ma), run by the [https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smi](Sheffield Methods Institute), which teaches a full suite of quantative and qualatative research skills. The SMI is also home to the [Data Analytics and Society Centre for Doctoral Training](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smi/postgraduate/data-analytics-society-cdt) which offers opportunities to undertake a 4-year funded integrated MSc and PhD.

## Careers

Inside or outside of research, data management and visualisation skills will be good for your career. Unlike many high-technical skills, coding is highly accessible. Even in the world of software development, over half of programmers are [self-taught](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2908474/stack-overflow-survey-finds-nearly-half-have-no-degree-in-computer-science.html). But coding is relevant to more than just pure software jobs, [one report](https://www.burning-glass.com/research-project/coding-skills/) found that 20% of graduate-level jobs value coding as a skill, and these jobs paid on average 30% more than other graduate jobs.
