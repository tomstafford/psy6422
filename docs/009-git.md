## Before the class

Create an account on [github.com](https://github.com/), if you don't already have one.

If you have RStudio you can access git using point and click (top right), or via the terinmal (the tab next to Console on the bottom right). 

Outside of RStudio:

 * Students using windows can install: https://gitforwindows.org/ Once installed they should be able to open a git bash window and type ``git --version``
 * Students on a Mac will have git if they install 'Xcode' and 'Command line tools for Xcode'.They can test by opening a terminal and typing ``git --version``

## Exercise - publishing your project with github pages

1. Create a new github repositry (a "repo")
    * click "initilise with README.md"
2. Add an .html file called index.html. This file can be created by clicking 'knit' in RStudio from your .Rmd file (see the class on [Rmarkdown](rmarkdown.html))
    * You can add to a repo via the command line, in which case you need to add, commit and push to the remote repositry
    * or you can drag and drop the upload via the webpage
    * **NOTE**: To make the repositry an archive of your project you can and should add all the other other files and folders, including the .Rmd file which you used to make the index.html file
3. Via the webpage click "Settings" and scroll down to "Github Pages". Under "Source" select "Master branch".
4. Find your pages, after a short moment, at [yourusername.github.io/yourreponame]()
    * Example: my repo is at [github.com/tomstafford/supertues](https://github.com/tomstafford/supertues), so the published pages are at [tomstafford.github.io/supertues](https://tomstafford.github.io/supertues/)
