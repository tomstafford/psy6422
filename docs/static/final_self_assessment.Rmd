# Marking Criteria

See the Assessment criteria document for these. Roughly they are:

Submit by the deadline (see Timetable) in PDF by email to ``t.stafford@sheffield.ac.uk``. Use the filename format ``surname_registrationnumber.pdf``

Answer the questions in the headings below, showing evidence of engagement with the course

Note: I expect and hope that all students can get full marks for this assessment. There is no word limit, but short is sweet. I suggest you write between 3 sentences and 3 paragraphs for each.
