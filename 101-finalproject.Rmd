## Choosing your data

The data is an excuse for the data visualisation, so don't agonise over this, and go for simple over complex if you have a choice. I recommend you find a data set with variables which you understand. The lecture on March 19th covered how to find open data. 

### Finding Data

I will update these notes soon, but basically many papers are now published accommpanied by open data. Sometimes this is indicated by an Open Data Badge. For example, take a look at the [current table of contents for Psychological Science](https://journals.sagepub.com/toc/pss/current). The badges are an initiative of the Centre for Open Science https://cos.io/our-services/open-science-badges/

You can also search a preprint archive such as [psyarxiv](https://psyarxiv.com/). Many, but not all, papers published as preprints will have open data. You can also search [OSF.io](https://osf.io/) directly. 

Pick a topic and have a look at what is available

The other route is large publicly available resources, such as [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)


## Choose your graph

You only need to draw one graph, but more is permitted.

The important thing is to show - either in the graph, or in text, or both - that you have thought about the logic of what you are visualising, *how* it shows the information and *why* this important


## Check list

Here are some questions to ask youself as you prepare your project

* do I care about this topic and/or data?
* do you have access to the raw data?
* can load it?
  * if you can open it in a spreadsheet you will be definitely be able to open it in R, but you will still want to check if it is well formatted when you load it in R
    * for example, if different cells have different amounts of information in your data won't import nicely
    * or, if you important information is contained in cell colours then this won't be avaialble when you import into R
* Do you understand it?
  * is there a code book?
  * do you know what the columsn are?
  * do you understand the values?
