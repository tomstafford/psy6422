The topics we cover are:

1. Module overview - ethics and aesthetics of visualisaion, the importance of reproducible workflows
2. Project organisation - fundamentals of data storage, syncronisation and sharing
3. R / Rstudio - introduction to the statistical computing language
4. Making graphs
5. Data Management
6. Data Management 2
7. Coding principles - fundamental principles of coding, writing good code, asking for help
8. Rmarkdown
9. Git and github
10. Publishing to pages - like this one!
11. Better graphs / preview of advanced topics

Stretch goals:

Unfortunately we won't have time this year for a number of advanced topics which I would like to cover. Hopefully next year:

* Jupyter notebooks
* The terminal / ssh
* Interactive visualisation with Shiny apps
* SQL

## Example Projects

The bulk of the assessment is to conduct and publish your own analysis project. Here is an example small project which gives an idea of what I mean

* SuperTues: [Published](https://tomstafford.github.io/supertues/), [repo](https://github.com/tomstafford/supertues)

Stretch goal is to build an interactive data visualisation using Shiny

* Here's one I built earlier [Power analyser](https://sheffield-university.shinyapps.io/decision_power/)
