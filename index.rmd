Stretch goals:

* Shiny apps

## Example Projects

The bulk of the assessment is to conduct and publish your own analysis project. Here is an example small project which gives an idea of what I mean

* SuperTues: [Published](https://tomstafford.github.io/supertues/), [repo](https://github.com/tomstafford/supertues)

Stretch goal is to build an interactive data visualisation using Shiny

* Here's one I built earlier [Power analyser](https://sheffield-university.shinyapps.io/decision_power/)

## General righteousnous

You should use a password manager. Really. [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com) is recommended

You should know how to use a VPN

* Advice for Sheffield students here: [Working remotely - information for students](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/it-services/remote/students)
* You can test by visiting [this page](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797613511466). If you are in the University network (either on campus or via a VPN) it will offer you the chance to download the article PDF. Otherwise it will try and charge you $35 for the privelege.
